1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a JavaScript library that is used for creating user interfaces and applications. React allows developers to create large scale applications much more easily and quicker, which makes it easier to stay up to date. Another problem that React solves is the hassle of writing in three different languages, because it combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


1. Describe component state.

Component state is basically just the data of the component, as in the state of the component, at any given point. With react we can add things to change the state of the app that will happen when the user triggers that thing.


1. Describe props.

Props is short for properties of the data we are using, and they are things you can pass to other components with react in order to get data from a parent element into a child element. We can use the data in props in child components to figure out how or where we want to change the component's state.


1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

A side effect is something that happens outside the scope of a function that is invoked. In React, we can use the useEffect() function to tell a component that we want it to have a certain side effect. This allows us to change things outside of the function when it is executed, such as fetching data from another website.
